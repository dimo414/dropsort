# Dropsort

Experimenting with optimizations to the
[Dropsort](http://www.dangermouse.net/esoteric/dropsort.html) algorithm.

## Origin

Abram Jackson and Ryan McCulloch
[presented](https://prezi.com/uml--gxaifox/item-retention-improvements-to-dropsort-a-lossy-sorting-algorithm/)
a [paper](http://micsymposium.org/mics_2011_proceedings/mics2011_submission_13.pdf) exploring two
optimizations to the naive Dropsort implementation. The source code for that paper is in the
[`Research`](/Research) directory.
